    Linus "Hey CS, how's the new video coming along?"
    CS "It's going well, I have the background all done and I'm working on adding graphics and fixing audio."
    Linus "Wow! You're a fast worker, you'll get off of those old 2080s in no time."
    CS "Thanks Linus."
    Linus "Speaking of livestreaming, we need a new PC for the WAN Show, can you go and buy parts for one?"
    CS "Sure, what parts do you need?"
    Linus "We need eggs, milk..."
    Linus "Just kidding."
    Linus "I'll leave the details up to you since you've done a lot of livestreaming, just get the highest end available."
    CS "Alright, I'll go get the parts."
