    CS "It's okay, I get it. Thanks for the job, I'll see you tommorow."

    CS "Wow! I thought this was an office, why do I get such a cool desk?"
    Linus "Actually, this is our worst setup, you'll get upgraded after you've been here a while."
    CS "Holy shit, really? This is way better than any setup I've seen, let alone had."
    Linus "You must've had really bad setups then, this only has 2080s, everyone else has 2080 TIs or GTX Titans."
    CS "I have absolutely no problem with 2080s."
    Linus "Well, enjoy!"

    CS "Let's see, I have the new TechQuickie video on how livestreaming works, or the video on how at least half of the keys on your keyboard should be macros..."
    CS "{i}Dammit Teran, you can edit your own macro fetish content.{/i}"
    CS "I guess I'll edit the livestreaming one."

    CS "It's going well, I have the background all done and I'm working on adding graphics and fixing audio."
    Linus "Wow! You're a fast worker, you'll get off of those old 2080s in no time."
    CS "Thanks Linus."
    Linus "Speaking of livestreaming, we need a new PC for the WAN Show, can you go and buy parts for one?"
    CS "Sure, what parts do you need?"
    Linus "We need eggs, milk..."
    Linus "Just kidding."
    Linus "I'll leave the details up to you since you've done a lot of livestreaming, just get the highest end available."
    CS "Alright, I'll go get the parts."
